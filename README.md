# Oldwood
is a small Python game *(or rendering?)* engine inspired by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, by drawing backgrounds, and then the overlay, and then onscreen sprites. It's supposed to also support audio, music and game code (also in Python) in the future.

It is by NO means an SNES emulator, just an inspired machine that wants to someday grow up into a big machine :>
